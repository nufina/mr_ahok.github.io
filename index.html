      <div class="contents">
        <p>Basuki Tjahaja Purnama or known as "Ahok" is an Indonesian politician and former governor of Jakarta. He is also known by his Hakka Chinese nickname Ahok (Chinese: 阿學). Basuki is the second governor with Chinese ancestry and also the second Christian governor of Jakarta, following Henk Ngantung, who was governor from 1964-65.</p>
        <p>Basuki was a legislator in the Indonesian People's Representative Council and Regent of East Belitung. He was elected to the Komisi II House of Representatives for the 2009–2014 term but resigned in 2012 to run in the Jakarta governor election. He was inaugurated as the governor of Jakarta by the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, on 19 November 2014. However in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election he was defeated by Anies Baswedan.</p>
        <p>During his tenure as the governor of Jakarta, he made a controversial speech while introducing a government project at Thousand Islands in which he referenced a verse from the Quran to not vote for a non-Muslim as a leader. Some Muslim communities were offended and seen this speech as blasphemous, thus reported him to the police. He was later convicted of blasphemy against Islam by the North Jakarta District Court and sentenced to two years imprisonment.He was replaced by his deputy, Djarot Saiful Hidayat.</p>
